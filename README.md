#An Intro Activity

The [**Telegram for Android**](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) app shows a simple and nice Intro Activity.
But it does not use a viewpager. It uses FrameLayout's, so I have added the viewpagerlibrary instead.

Now, I think it looks nicer :)

Also, I did this because I didn't found any examples on Internet of how to make an activity like this one.
